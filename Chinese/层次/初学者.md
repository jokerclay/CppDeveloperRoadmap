# C++ 初学者

## 谁是初学者？

初学者是熟悉语言语法并且可以编写简单无需第三方库的程序的人。 该程序执行简单的过程，例如：
- 算术运算
- 文件操作：读或写
- 等待键盘输入
- 在控制台中展示结果或其他数据
- 等等.

## 被期望有什么样的编程能力?
- 使用以下 IDE 之一创建和构建一个小型能跑的 C++ 项目：Visual Studio、Qt Creator 等等。
- 使用 IDE 的调试器
- 理解 C++ 程序编译链接的过程
- 使用算术运算和逻辑操作符,条件，循环写程序
- 使用标准输入输出流写程序
- 使用指针和引用
- 了解应用程序中使用的内存类型
- 了解C++框架中的基本OOP：继承、多态、封装。

## 被期望大体上有什么技能？

- 渴望学习和获得新知识
- 渴望解决遇到的问题
- 能够编写查询语句在搜索引擎或相应的文献中找到问题的解决方案

## 小技巧和推荐

### 学习

- There is no silver bullet to help you learn C++ in one day/week/month. Get ready for the lengthy unsupervised learning of all kinds of material before you are able to pass the interview to get your first job offer.
- 没有能在一天/星期/月 就学会 C++ 的捷径。在通过面试获得第一份工作机会之前，准备好对各种材料进行漫长的无监督学习。
- If you feel that you don't understand some topic, look for alternative sources.
- 如果你感觉对一些方面不是很理解，寻找更多来源。
- Practice and only practice will let you harness C++! You'll forget most of what you read or hear without regular coding.
- 联系而且只有联系才能让你驾驭C++！ 没有日常的编码你会忘记大部分你读到的和听到的。
- Don't try to write perfect code. Your main goal is to write a pile of code that WORKS, i.e. does exactly what is required. You need to learn to communicate with the computer. It's similar to studying foreign languages. First you talk sloppily, but then you refine your skills, you get a better feel of the grammar, you expand your vocabulary, and so on.
- 不要尝试去写完美的代码，你的主要目标是写一堆能跑的代码，换而言之完全符合要求。 您需要学习与计算机。 这类似于学习外语。 首先你说话草率，但随后你提高了你的技能，你对语法有了更好的感觉，你扩大了你的词汇量，等等。
- Don't jump at a huge problem at once - like creating your own game. In the beginning you are likely to lack the knowledge and experience to cope with the task alone. This approach frustrates quickly and leads to the disappointment in oneself and one's abilities, forcing to abandon education. Better progress from simple to complicated, gradually inventing more and more difficult tasks for yourself.
- Don't focus on Leetcode and Codewars and other similar resources at first. The purpose of these portals is to refine the skill of the application of classic algorithms and data structures. These playgrounds are designed to abstract away the details of the programming languages. This won't benefit you considerably in the beginning, it's better to focus on the language itself and its capabilities.

### 英语

- It's easier to look for the solutions in English, but don't torture yourself if your current language proficiency isn't high enough. You might get demotivated too soon. Most of the problems you are likely to encounter in the beginning are searchable in your native language.
- If you feel that your English is insufficient, start studying it through the use of simpler and more pleasant means: series, video games, fiction, news outlets or articles you're interested in. Several months are enough to refine your skill of English comprehension.
