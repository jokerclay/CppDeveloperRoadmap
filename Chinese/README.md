# C++ 开发者之路

## 其他语言: [Русский](Russian/README.md) [English](../README.md)

C++ 仍然是[最流行的开发语言之一](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies). 很多人想开始学习它并且成为一名 C++ 开发者。 他们面临这样一个问题：“我应该从哪里开始？我应该学习什么以及按什么顺序学习？我应该读什么书？”

We tried to answer these questions in the presented roadmap. The map focuses on general competencies and skills that could be found in most projects. It is designed to help those who are just starting their education or have little experience. You can create a more productive learning plan without being distracted by side information if you study the set of listed materials. It will help you to master C++ at the level that is used in many commercial projects.
